# Contacts App

You are required to build a contact management
application that has the following functionalities,


1. Sign-up where the user will be allowed to enter his emailID and password along
with a secret code. This data will be validated and sent to the backend where the
data will be stored in a Database.


2. Sign-in where the user will be allowed to enter his emailID and password. This
data will be sent to the backend where it will be cross-checked with the data
available in the database and a proper response is returned to the frontend.

contacts. The form should have fields such as
